# bdwgc-d

D library for interfacing with libgc (bdwgc) using [`importC`](https://dlang.org/spec/importc.html)

### Compiler Support

`bdwgc-d` should be compatible with multiple D compilers including `gdc`, `ldc2`, and `dmd`. When you use `dub` to build your project, it should automatically detect the compiler you have installed and use it to compile your code.
